Lets say you want to test out an idea for a robot car, DVD changing robot arm, automatic card sorter or something similar. Machining your own parts would be time consuming. So what are the options for rapid prototyping?

    
## Lego Mindstorm
The best known option and a huge community

![alt text](/images/maker/lego-rover.jpg "Lego")

Easy to find help and wide variety of parts. You can get hold of lego mindstorm in almost any toystore. The downside is that lego is its own world. Lego parts don't mesh naturally with regular industrial components. You are typically limited to using parts made specifically for lego.

## Meccano

Readily available and works quite well with non meccano parts from industry

![alt text](/images/maker/meccano-crane.jpg "Meccano")

In Norway you can find Meccano at:

* [Clas Ohlson][clas]
* [Riktige Leker][riktigleker]
* [Teknisk Museum](http://www.tekniskmuseum.no/nettbutikk)

It is slower to put together things with Meccano than with Lego but the benefit is that the same approach for connecting things as "real" objects: screws and nuts. So you can more easily connect it to standard industrial components.

It also give a more solid construction, which you could keep as the final version if you want to.

## [Fischertechnik](/prototyping/fischertechnik)

Plastic parts like lego, but designed mainly for prototyping machines and engineering structures

![Fischertechnik Rover](/images/maker/fischertechnik-rover.jpg)

The way pieces are fitted together is very different from  Lego. It is similar to how industrial prototyping systems such as [T-slots][tnut] works. In fact it can be combined with [OpenBeam][openbeam] aluminium T-slots. This makes the system one of the most flexible ones covered on this page. Unlike Lego and Meccano pieces do not need to be fitted together at fixed points. The main downside [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] is that:

* Largely unknown outside of Germany.
* Can't buy kits in your average toystore.
* Much smaller community than Lego Mindstorm

## MakerBeam and OpenBeam

A [T-slot][tnut] system for small hobby sized constructions

![alt text](/images/maker/makerbeam.jpg "MakerBeam")


[T-slots][tnut] used in the industry is usually 20x20mm, which is often impractical for a hobbyist. However this size dominates for 3D printer designs.

[MakerBeam][makerbeam] sells a variety of T-slots which are smaller than 20x20mmm. Their original beams simply called [MakerBeam][mbeamsmall] are 10x10 mm which is pratical for more detailed work.

They have two types of beams which are 15x15mm, called [OpenBeam][openbeam] and [MakerBeamXL][mbeamlarge]. This is a very convenient size because it is exactly the same as standard [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] building blocks. That means one can combine with the extensive number of parts existing for the [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] building system. It means you could prototype something really fast without using any screws in [fischertechnik][fischertechnik], and once you get it working, start replacing plastic T-slots with aluminium ones.

The fact that they have two types of 15x15mm slots requires some explanation. [OpenBeam][openbeam] was a separate competing product previously. While I have a bunch of [OpenBeam][openbeam] T-slots I think [MakerBeamXL][mbeamlarge] is probably a better choice today. They have threaded holes at the end so you can easily attach the ends. You don't have to tap threaded holes yourself.  

What is practical with the 15x15mm T-slots [MakerBeam][makerbeam] sells is that they can be used with standard M3 nuts and bolts. A lot of T-slot systems require specialized nuts and bolts. E.g. the 10x10mm beams require special screw heads or nuts.

MakerBeams are not sold with ready made kits, including instructions such as Lego, Meccano and Fischertechnik. Using it requires more knowledge. [MakerBeams][makerbeam] are really just beams, brackets and screws. You have to buy industry standard motors, gears etc to make something usefull. That is both a benefit and a downside. It means you can use parts made for the industry which is often cheaper than specialzed stuff from e.g. Lego.

## MakeBlock

[MakeBlock][makeblock] is the the closest thing to a modern incarnation of Meccano sets. They sell whole kits like Lego, Meccano and Fischertechnik, but which are based on combining aluminium parts with screws.

One advantage of [MakeBlock][makeblock] is that they seem to be available a lot of places. There are many stores in Norway which sells them, unlike e.g. [fischertechnik][fischertechnik] which is generally quite unknown outside of Germany.

It is hard to
