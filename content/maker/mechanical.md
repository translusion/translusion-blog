I am not aiming to give an exhaustive guide here. This is mainly to get you started. I will link to more in depth articles. The problem I am trying to address here is that when you start out you end up on a wild goose chase with google to find out stuff. I will focus on mentioning mistakes I've made which might aid in getting the right parts or using them correctly.

# Where to buy mechanical parts

A problem when buying mechanical parts is that the stores are usually made for professionals so it can be difficult to determine the right thing to get.

## RS

[rs][rs] has one of the largest selections of products. That is both a benefit and a problem. You can get electric motors, wires, screws etc lots of places. But if you want to get hold of things such as:

* Pulleys
* Actuators
* Gears
* Axel collars

And a whole host of other things then [rs][rs] is the best choice.
