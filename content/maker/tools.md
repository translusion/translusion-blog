Most of these tools you can get at stores such as: 

* [Clas Ohlson][clas]
* [Jernia][jernia]
* [Byggmaker][byggmaker]
* [Maxbo][maxbo]

[Clas Ohlson][clas] might be your first choice because they have a good selection and are usually easily accessible in shopping centers around Norway.

# Drilling holes

When you drill a hole there are a lot of issues and challenges to consider:

* Is the hole straight?
* Do you want to put screws into it or rod or axel later?
* What to do when the hole is almost big enough but not quite.
* Are all my holes accurately aligned with each other?
* Are there any differences between making holes in wood or plastic.

To answer these questions I'd like to show some tools you should be aware of for working with holes.

### Deburring Tool

Take off sharp edges or enlarge holes

When you drill a hole you can get a rough edge for the hole or the hold didn't get quite large enough. Do deal with this you can use a deburring tool It can smoothen an edge or enlarge a hole slightly. Usually you buy these in kits because you need a different one depending on *material* you want to deburr. I could be refered to as a *edge off* tool rather than *deburring tool*.

### Taper Tool

Make screw holes or turn a metal rod into a screw

When you drill a hole it will be smooth inside so e.g. a machine screw won't fasten in the hole. You need to cut a thread out of the side of the hole. This is called "tapping" and you do it by fastening a tap in a tap wrench (shown above):

You then screw the tap into the hole by hand in similar fashion to how you screw a screw. When you are done, you have to unscrew it carefully avoiding to ruin the thread you just cut. To turn a smooth metal rod into a screw you perform "threading" on it using a die wrench.
