What spurred me to create the favorites section in the first place, was that I began reflecting on the fact that so many of the movies and series that I have really liked over the years have often been kind of quirky, odd and not mainstream. Hence it is easy to forget them.

Of course I also like a lot of mainstream movies, but those are not as easily forgotten.

## Quirky Series

- [Teenage Bounty Hunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Bounty_Hunters)

- [The End of the F***ing World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_the_F***ing_World)
- [Maniac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)) with Jonah Hill and Emma Stone.
