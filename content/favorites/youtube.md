The system to organize and locate favorites on Youtube plain sucks I have realized. And so this is an attempt at organizing an overview over things I have come to like on youtube. Mostly stuff I like but which I don't necessarily watch often and thus forget where is located.

- [City Beautiful](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGc8ZVCsrR3dAuhvUbkbToQ) A channel about city planning. In particular I found it interesting watching a video about Soviet City planning.

- [Ben Eater](https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc) has a nuber of interesting videos on how to build a simple computer from scratch on a breadboard. How a binary adder workks. Assembly and Machine code.

- [Nordic Prison System](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_4YqiptlUqNnh3STGVXeDQ) John Stark has a number of videos introducing people to the Nordic prisons, sometimes with Americans visiting and learning about these prisons. Some are part of the "The Norden" series.
