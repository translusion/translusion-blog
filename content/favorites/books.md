Not so much favorites as simply a list of good books or books I found interesting or important in different ways. This is just updated randomly as the books comes to mind.

## Science Fiction

- [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)) A realistic science fiction book about an astronaut stranded on Mars. Similar in concept to Robinson Crusoe.
- [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer) William Gibsons classic cyberpunk novel. Introduce many of the ideas we will see much later in movies such as the Matrix.


## Economics and Society

Books written on economics and society in general which I found interesting, enlightening or memorable.  

- [The Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations) by Adam Smith, published 1776. This is a classic, which made a lasting impression on me. Despite its age there are some deep insights here and it is a fairly entertaining read in my opinion.

- [Guns, Germs, and Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel). Basically a book about why some countries got rich and others did not. A novel insight is that it demonstrates how geography and climate profoundly influences culture and development. 

- [Freakconomics](https://freakonomics.com/books). Interesting book on how to think about all sorts of issues in society like an economist. Deals with a host of issues one would not normally think about as being about economics, such as relationship between crime and abortion.

- [The Undercover Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undercover_Economist). Many similarities to Freakonomics in that it explains a lot of everyday experiences through economics.

- [Debt: The First 5000 Years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years) A book that really helps explain the origin and nature of money.

- [Bullshit Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) A thought provoking book, exposing that around 40% of the jobs in the West are pointless.
