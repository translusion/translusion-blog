Current QRude is a simple QR Code scanner which is aimed at batch processing QR codes. The intention is to develop it into an app which can be paired up with OS X apps which needs to scan QR codes or bar codes. Example of usage is e.g. scanning bar codes on books to compose a list of ISBN numbers of books. But my intention for creating this app was to use it for scanning security related info stored on a QR code. E.g. it could be passwords or secrets you don't want to store on your computer.

Presently you can not do any kind of pairing like this, but newer versions will support that.
