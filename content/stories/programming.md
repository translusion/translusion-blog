I write mostly about different programming languages, tools for developers, various software libraries and to some extent about software engineering.

## Software Engineering

- [To Hell With Setters and Getters](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/to-hell-with-setters-and-getters-7814e7b2f949). A discussion of why setters and getter functions are often overused and used wrong in object-oriented software.
- [The Many Advantages of Dynamic Languages](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/the-many-advantages-of-dynamic-languages-267d08f4c7). An explanation of how the language becomes your tool when using a dynamic language for software development.
- [Why Use a Dynamic Language over a Statically Typed One?](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/why-use-a-dynamic-language-over-a-statically-typed-one-fb434994e2b6) 
- [Dynamically Typed Languages Are Not What You Think](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/dynamically-typed-languages-are-not-what-you-think-ac8d1392b803)

## Julia and Python Comparison
Julia is a relatively new programming language, so these stories explore various features and compare how Julia and Python achieve the same things with similar or different features.

- [Type Annotations in Julia and Python](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/type-annotations-in-julia-and-python-84b92d8f6cfb)
- [String Interpolation in Julia and Python](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/string-interpolation-in-julia-and-python-e6c4ea71e577)
- [Ranges and Slices in Julia and Python](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/ranges-and-slices-in-julia-and-python-bb0fd893a20c)
- [Coroutines and Tasks in Julia and Python](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/coroutines-and-tasks-in-julia-and-python-c82f7ec52a9e). Coroutines is an alternative to threads, which are practical to use in handling concurrency. E.g. while waiting for a network connection in one coroutine task one can switch to another. Because only one coroutine ever runs, handling access to shared resources is less complicated than with threads.
- [Python’s “with as” Statement in Julia, JavaScript, Lua and Other Languages](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/pythons-with-as-statement-in-julia-javascript-lua-and-other-languages-e2d29941959a)
- [Defining Custom Units in Julia and Python](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/defining-custom-units-in-julia-and-python-513c34a4c971). I show how Julia's multiple dispatch and  type system is very practical in defining units such as Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin. 
- [Python Experience from a Julia Perspective](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/python-vs-julia-observations-e61ee667fa95). A subjective view of Python from Julia perspective. This was an early impression and I should write a better analysis some time.
- [Julia is designed for ML Python isn’t](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/julia-is-designed-for-ml-python-isnt-dd8ee29cdd5a). Some reflections on why Julia is better designed for Machine Learning.

## Julia and JavaScript Comparison
- [JavaScript and Julia Difference in Core Concepts](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/javascript-and-julia-difference-in-core-concepts-e5783e8ddf32). A discussion of inheritance, string interpolation, null values, iterators and generators.
- [Python’s “with as” Statement in Julia, JavaScript, Lua and Other Languages](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/pythons-with-as-statement-in-julia-javascript-lua-and-other-languages-e2d29941959a)

## Julia Programming
- [Knights, Pikemen, Archers and Multiple Dispatch](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/knights-pikemen-archers-and-multiple-dispatch-69aaee2c4141). A fun introduction to the Julia programming language.
- [Types in C/C++ and Julia ](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/types-in-c-c-and-julia-ce0fcbe0dec6). There are superficial similarities between C/C++ and Julia type system. To a novice it can look as if Julia is statically typed just like C/C++. I explain in more detail while type annotations doesn't necessarily make a language statically typed.
- [Calcutron-33: A Decimal Based RISC Microprocessor](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/decimal-risc-cpu-a13968922812) A variant of the Little Man Computer, which follows a more RISC like design.
- [Example Programs for Calcutron-33](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/minimal-programs-f3dbd8bc1d4a)

## Tools
- [Why I Don’t Like IDEs](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/why-i-dont-like-ides-6654adb179cb). A discussion of what I think are the problems with integrated development environments in software development, and an explanation of the benefits of the alternatives.
- [The Many Advantages of Dynamic Languages](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/the-many-advantages-of-dynamic-languages-267d08f4c7). An explanation of how the language becomes your tool when using a dynamic language for software development.
