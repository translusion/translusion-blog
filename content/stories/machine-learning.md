I have written a number of space themed stories. I am trying to appeal to those new to the field and who are curious. So I have tried to write some friendly explanations of how a rocket engine works. What makes a good rocket fuel. Some of the background for these more education articles is to make it easier for people who are excited about what is going on at SpaceX, Blue Origin, NASA, Rockets Labs and other places and want to understand more of the terminology.

I also have a number of articles on colonizing Venus, as that is a planet closer to Earth than Mars, but very seldom discussed in the media. Space colonization opens up for the discussion of a wide variety of topics: How will people eat, how will they societies be organized politically. How will they get power, produce things etc.

## Flux Machine Learning Library

- [Gentle Introduction to Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/machine-learning-for-dummies-in-julia-6cd4d2e71a46). A story focused on understanding what machine learning is actually about in general. We cover important topics like:
	- Automatic Differentiation
	- What is a Gradient and why are they important to machine learning.
	- The Gradient Descent method. 
- [Implementation of a Modern Machine Learning Library](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/implementation-of-a-modern-machine-learning-library-3596badf3be). We look under the hood of Flux, to see how it is implemented. Flux is a machine learning library based on automatic differentiation of any regular Julia function. This is the modern approach to ML.
- [Recognize Handwriting Using an Artificial Neural Network](https://medium.com/better-programming/handwriting-recognition-using-an-artificial-neural-network-78060d2a7963). Introduces standard neural network concepts such as perceptrons, layers and activation functions using the Flux ML library.
