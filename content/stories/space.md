I have written a number of space themed stories. I am trying to appeal to those new to the field and who are curious. So I have tried to write some friendly explanations of how a rocket engine works. What makes a good rocket fuel. Some of the background for these more education articles is to make it easier for people who are excited about what is going on at SpaceX, Blue Origin, NASA, Rockets Labs and other places and want to understand more of the terminology.

I also have a number of articles on colonizing Venus, as that is a planet closer to Earth than Mars, but very seldom discussed in the media. Space colonization opens up for the discussion of a wide variety of topics: How will people eat, how will they societies be organized politically. How will they get power, produce things etc.
