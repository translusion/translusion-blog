Economics and politics has been a hot topic ever since the 2008 financial crisis. Increasingly more people are asking question about whether our current economic and political system works for the benefit of its citizens.

I am trying to give a Scandinavian and social democratic perspective on a lot of these issues.

Especially for people on the political left who want to learn more about economics, it is hard to not get a very libertarian or conservative view presented if you are reading in English. Thus here I am trying to discuss various Economic issues seen from a more Scandinavian social democratic perspective.
