The topics I cover in science and mathamatics is often related to topics I have stuggled with understanding in the past or wanted to find a way to teach my children. I try to write stuff that is very beginner friendly. Laying out all the individual steps and not assume too much prior knowledge.

## Mathematics

- [Why Does the Number 12 Occur so Frequently?](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/why-does-the-number-12-pop-up-so-often-7f33d8b0faa8). Reflections on the number 12 and why so many things are divided into 12 such as the clock, egg packages, a foot, pennies in a shilling.

- [Teaching Kids About Alternative Number Bases](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/teaching-kids-about-alternative-number-bases-36e3cc464250). This article is about helping children really understand how numbrs works. Specifically this deals with the dozenal number system. An alterantive to the decimal number system.

- [The Core Idea of Linear Algebra](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/the-core-idea-of-linear-algebra-7405863d8c1d)
- [Why Does Matrix Multiplication Work the Way it Does?](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/why-does-matrix-multiplication-work-the-way-it-does-7a8ed9739254)
- [Functions in Mathematics and Programming](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/functions-in-mathematics-and-programming-9741cbeb8d4b)
- [Reflections on Math, Tensors and Programming](https://nextjournal.com/erik-engheim/reflections-tensors)

## Geometry
- [Software for Teaching Geometry](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/computer-tools-for-teaching-geometry-a12fdfd1f13e). Using GeoGebra for what we call constructive geometry. This is learning about how 90 degree angles, special triangles, shorters lines and so on can be made with a compass and ruler.
- [Geometry for Navigation](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/geometry-for-navigation-c975c41bdcaa). How angles can be measured and used together with understanding of geometry to perform navigation. We look at how things like triangulation works, used by GPS positioning system.

## Physics

- [Understanding Gyroscopes](https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/understanding-gyroscopes-2a92ef64f6cc) Starting from scratch explaining all the match and physics concepts you need to understand to grasp the behavior of Gyroscopes.
