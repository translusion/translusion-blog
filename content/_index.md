title: "Erik Engheim's Projects and Articles"
---

This is a collection articles and blogs I have written as well as apps I've made and projects. I've tried to collect some info for other Norwegian Makers who might not always know where to get parts for their robot, machine or electronics projects. Some of my interests in computer science is covered here, such as Crypto currencies, Cryptography, Programming languages, UX and Software Engineering.
